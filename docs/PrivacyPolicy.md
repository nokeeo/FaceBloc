## Use of personal data
We do not collect, save, nor use your personal data.  We do not have access to personal data recorded in FaceBloc. FaceBloc may request access to your Photo Library, however this is for the sole purpose of importing your photos into FaceBloc for editing and saving the edited photos to the library.

FaceBloc uses facial recognition to find faces within an image to obfuscate them. The facial image analysis is done on the device and is never shared with the developer or any other party.

If you choose to do so, the authors of FaceBloc may receive aggregate application health statistics, like energy usage and crash reports. This is to improve the application and reports are opt-in and provided by Apple. To enable or disable analytics toggle the following switch in the device Settings on iOS 13, `Privacy-> Analytics -> Share With App Developers` .
