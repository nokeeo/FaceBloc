# FaceBloc
An iOS app that uses machine learning to automatically detect faces in a given photo and obscures them. All processing is done on the device and none of your personal information is sent to developer of this app.

The application also includes a draw tool to allow you to obfuscate any other identifying features.

This app will always be free, ad free and open source. We are looking for contributors (code and design).  See the contributing section for more details.

## Requirements
Built for iPhone and iPad running iOS 12+.

### Before Opening a PR
1. Fork the repository and make a branch off the `dev` branch and request a merge back into dev.

2. Ensure that you have run `clang-format` with the project style. This project adhears to the [Google style-guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.html) with minor alterations.
